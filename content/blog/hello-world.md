# Hello World

I've finally done it. I've taken the time to learn enough about web development
to set up my own blog. I may tweak the styling a little in the future, but I
think the bare bones look will never really be out of date.

I'm using [hugo](https://gohugo.io/) to build this site. It may seem a little
overkill for something so simple, but I find it quite easy to use despite its
power, and it allows me to compose these posts in markdown.

It is not yet entirely clear to me how I will use this blog, however i am
glad that I now have the infrastructure in place should I have thoughts to
put into words.
